bromwell high is a cartoon comedy . it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life  
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig . starts out with a opening scene that
homelessness  or houselessness as george carlin stated  has been an issue   
airport    starts as a brand new luxury    plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  
brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic   
this film lacked something i couldn  t put my finger on at first charisma   
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon .   
sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but   
this is not the typical mel brooks film . it was much less   
when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors .
